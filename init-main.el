;; I want to keep this file as minimal as possible. It is important
;; that this file remain self-contained.

;;; Code:
;;  =====

(require 'package)

;; Set up emacs package archives with 'package
;; Main package archive
(add-to-list 'package-archives
             '("melpa" . "http://melpa.org/packages/") t)
;; Some packages might only do stable releases?
(add-to-list 'package-archives
	     '("melpa-stable" . "http://stable.melpa.org/packages/") t)
;; Org packages, I don't use org but seems like a harmless default
(add-to-list 'package-archives
             '("org-elpa" . "https://orgmode.org/elpa/") t)
(package-initialize)

;; Ensure use-package is present. From here on out, all packages are
;; loaded with use-package, a macro for importing and installing
;; packages. Also, refresh the package archive on load so we can pull
;; the latest packages.
